@*
    This file should not have any content placed in it
    other than @ directives in addition to the required
    single @implements ITab line below. All content
    destined to appear in the body of a step should be
    between the <FsmStepBody> and </FsmStepBody> and hence
    will appear as @ChildContent in the parent component.
    Ideally you should remove this comment too, as it adds
    to the payload delivered to the client!
